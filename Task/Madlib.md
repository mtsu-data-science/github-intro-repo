## Introductory Madlib

This project is a collaboration between MTSU and {1 plural noun}. Running support throughout this project, we have Alex A. the {2 fanciful title}, and Alex M. the {3 fanciful title}. Together, they make a {4 adjective} team! The {5 noun} might be challenging and the objectives might {6 verb}, but this project will make a great addition to any {7 noun}. Stay {8 adjective} and remember to {9 verb} via Slack, regularly if you have a {10 noun}. Good luck as we embark on this {11 traveling-related noun} together and {12 verb} these issues as professional {13 noun}. Cheers!
